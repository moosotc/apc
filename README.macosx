Tested on Mac OS X Tiger (PPC)
SMP - not tested
Kernel accounting appears to be rather chaotic (... and wrong ...)
       According to cursory glance at XNU source code it also updates
       accounting times during timer interrupts, in effect behavior
       is mostly the same as the on in Linux (Documentation/cpu-load.txt)

No kernel mode driver hence no workaround. Same RDTSC/RDPMC hackery can
be used on Intel versions.
