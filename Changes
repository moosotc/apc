   viewport

 * Make QUIRK mode uncoditional for 2.6 series of kernels

 * Modify hog to use lower (than 1ns) timer frequency

   to adjust permissions to device)

 * Add a simple command line based utility to report idleness of
   all the available processors (Linux only)

11
 * Fix constant bar width

 * Don't display things when the size of the view port is too small

 * Add a piece of information to the README about another possible
   module installation problem and a patch with a possible fix.
   Thanks to Jonathan Derque for reporting and helping with this
   issue
